8.12.15: T.G. 
Have uploaded a v0.1 of the game and secured one collaborator.
After a few mods, decided to put v0.1 in stasis and any new changes should be commited as further versions.
Any minor mods should be commited as seperate files. After a while, minor mods shall be collated into one new version of the game.
