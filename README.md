# Fallout-Shelter-Text-Based
An open source, text based version of the popular Bethesda Fallout Shelter game, with a few modifications, written in Python 3.

Notes:
I had this idea to help me get started with developing more advanced games. I am an aspiring software engineer and wanted to get serious about software and convinced myself to get an account on Github. I will now start developing projects in Python and (hopefully) other languages.
Disclaimer: I do not own this game. The intellectual property is the sole property of Zenimax Ent. and it's respected subsidiaries.
