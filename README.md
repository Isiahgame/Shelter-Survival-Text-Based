# Fallout-Shelter-Text-Based
An open source, text based version of the popular Bethesda Fallout Shelter game, with a few modifications, written in Python 3.
Fallout Shelter should have an inventory, crafting, room-building, room-rushing, and scrapping systems. The player shall be an overseer who is an actual character in the game, with their own stats. Uses Fallout S.P.E.C.I.A.L system.


Notes: By T.G.
I had this idea to help me get started with developing more advanced games. I am an aspiring software engineer and wanted to get serious about software and convinced myself to get an account on Github. I will now start developing projects in Python and (hopefully) other languages. 
You may realize we ain't that serious. We like Joker
